**Biggest Square Intro**

The goal of this program is to parse a file with a formatted header and a bitmap. Line 1 is always a header and remaining lines are part of the bitmap. 

Example 1:

`9.ox
...........................
....o......................
............o..............
...........................
....o......................
...............o...........
...........................
......o..............o.....
..o.......o................`

In Example 1, the `.`'s are empty space and the `o`'s are obstacles. This program should be able to find the biggest square of empty space in the bit map and out put fill character.

Example 2:

.....xxxxxxx...............
....oxxxxxxx...............
.....xxxxxxxo..............
.....xxxxxxx...............
....oxxxxxxx...............
.....xxxxxxx...o...........
.....xxxxxxx...............
......o..............o.....
..o.......o................

In Example 2, the biggest square is 7 by 7. Note that it doesn't look like a square, because ASCII characters are not square.

**Set up:** 

If you wish to read the exact requirements, please read the subject. 

In addition to a solutions to this coding challenge I have provided a couple of shell scripts. Make sure that you run `chmod +x run.sh` and `chmod +x file_builder.sh` before executing it. `run.sh` takes a integer as a count argument. This count will be the number of times a file with a random bit maps dimensions will be generated. A obstable character will be placed randomly in one position of each line of the bitmaps. Then the bsq.c (biggest square) will find where the biggest square in the randomly generated bitmap is. 

Try running `./run 100`.
